# Blocket Car Analysis

This project explores the factors that affect second-hand car prices and ownership costs in Sweden. Using scraped data from Blocket, technical specs from Transportstyrelsen, insurance prices from If, and vehicle registration trends from SCB (via API), we combine statistical inference and predictive modeling.

You can view the results in:

- [cars.md](cars.md): Predictive modeling and regression analysis for car prices, insurance, and tax
- [scb.md](scb.md): SCB data trends and policy-driven registration behavior

All code and processing steps are in `cars.Rmd`. The final HTML report is saved in the `docs/` folder.
